Getting and Cleaning Data
=========================

## Course Project

* Unzip the source into your working directory, eg: /Users/username/R 

* Then copy run_analysis.R into /Users/username/R/UCI HAR Dataset/

* Set your working directory to where the run_analysis.R was copied to, eg: setwd("/Users/username/R/UCI HAR Dataset/")

* you can either import run_analysic.R and run it using R studio or if you are using Mac or Linux simply run ./run_analysis.R in the command line.

* this will produce an output file named "data_set_with_averages.txt"

* to read the output use:  data <- read.table("data_set_with_the_averages.txt")
